A) The source code: You must upload your project to Github and send me the link before Sunday 8pm. 

B) An ER diagram or a Class Diagram: Use MySQL Model options to create a diagram of the resulting database or prepare a class diagram of your data model.

Goal: To create a database and the data access objects (DAOs) for a website to register volunteering projects and recruit for volunteers. There will be two types of user roles: Administrators and Volunteers:

Administrators should be able to create a project with a description, expected start and end dates, tasks required to be done (with a timeframe to be completed), update the status of the tasks and projects, indicate what type of resources are required for each task. It may also have a list of beneficiaries. Should be able to load pictures to enhance the descriptions, tasks and beneficiaries information.
Volunteers should be able to offer their services for tasks on projects.
